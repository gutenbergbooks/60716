<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">Though</span> I have now known my friend Louis McQuilland for well over a dozen
years I am only just beginning to understand him. It may be that he is
only just beginning to understand himself. But I am not so sure; for he
is an Irishman, and the Irish have, as compared with us, a remarkable
capacity both for knowing themselves and for keeping to themselves what
they know.</p>

<p>For what it is worth, my own interpretation of the earlier and the later
McQuilland&mdash;they afford in some ways a startling contrast&mdash;is something
like this. I conceive a young man, an Ulsterman of the Catholic
Nationalist minority, the fiercest section of the Fighting Race, coming
to London and finding himself among an alien people whose eyes were so
different from his own, and, with the quick observation and adaptability
of his people, saying to himself, “I must not talk about my country; for
that is treason. I must not talk about my religion; for that is mediæval
bigotry. Let us talk about Art.”</p>

<p>It is fair to Mr. McQuilland to say that he not only talked about Art
but produced it. How well he did the sort of work that English poets
were then trying to do, you may see in many poems of this volume, in
“The House of the Strange Woman,” for instance. But even in playing with
the Decadence there was always a sharp Irish edge to his execution.
Read, for example, the little poem called “Fleet Street.” It is a novel
of George Gissing’s in twelve lines. To the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_10" id="page_10">{10}</a></span> same period, though to a
different mood, belongs, I think, the really very beautiful poem called
“The Joyous Comrade.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless, when one turns to the poetry of a later date, and
especially to the several poems evoked by the present war, there is a
change in the very movement of the times which no one can miss. In spite
of bitter blunders on both sides&mdash;but especially on our side&mdash;I cannot
help feeling in that change a good omen for the future friendship of our
two countries. For a common crusade in defence of that by which all
Europeans live, if it has affected nothing else, has, I think, made
Louis McQuilland feel that he can give himself away ever so little to
the English. Even a little of him is an acceptable gift.</p>

<p>Among these later poems there is one which every Englishman ought to
read in these times. It is called “The Song of the Flag.” It is a song
of Internationalism by a Nationalist; and it may serve to emphasize the
much needed truth that friendship between nations, no less than enmity,
depends upon every nation remaining strictly individual and separate.
Two strong men shaking hands, perhaps after good blows given and taken,
is a fine sight. Briareus promiscuously shaking hands with himself&mdash;the
Modern idea of Internationalism&mdash;is not.</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
